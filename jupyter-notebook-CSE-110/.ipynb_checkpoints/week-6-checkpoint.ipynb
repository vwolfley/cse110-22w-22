    "\n",
    "#### Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a program to determine whether to loan money based on the following rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, ask for a rating from 1â€“10 on the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How large is the loan?\n",
    "* How good is your credit history?\n",
    "* How high is your income?\n",
    "* How large is your down payment?\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, you will create a boolean variable for whether you should loan the money that will be set to either True or False. Set up a series of if statements to decide if your decision to loan is \"yes\" or \"no\" according to the following rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "* First, check if the loan size is at least 5. If it is, use the following rules:\n",
    "    * If the credit history and income are both at least 7, then the decision is \"yes\"\n",
    "    * If either the credit history or income is at least 7, then check if the down payment is at least 5, if it is, the decision is \"yes\", if not, the decision is \"no\"\n",
    "    * Otherwise (if neither the credit history nor income is at least 7), the decision is \"no\"\n",
    "* Otherwise (if the loan is not 5 or greater), use these rules:\n",
    "    * If the credit is less than 4, then the decision is \"no\"\n",
    "    * Otherwise, check the following:\n",
    "        * If either the income or the down payment is at least 7, the decision is \"yes\"\n",
    "        * If both the income and the down payment are at least 4, then the answer is \"yes\"\n",
    "        * Otherwise, the decision is \"no\"\n",
    "Finally, display the decision to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Testing Procedure\n",
    "Verify that your program works correctly by following each step in this testing procedure:\n",
    "\n",
    "Test your program with these values and ensure you arrive at the decision indicated:\n",
    "1. Loan size: 8, Credit: 7, Income: 8, Down Payment: 1, Decision: \"yes\"\n",
    "2. Loan size: 5, Credit: 2, Income: 7, Down Payment: 5, Decision: \"yes\"\n",
    "3. Loan size: 8, Credit: 2, Income: 8, Down Payment: 3, Decision: \"no\"\n",
    "4. Loan size: 2, Credit: 4, Income: 1, Down Payment: 7, Decision: \"yes\"\n",
    "5. Loan size: 4, Credit: 5, Income: 5, Down Payment: 3, Decision: \"no\""

    "The local amusement park has just installed a new ride. Because of its speed and extreme twists and turns, it has very strict requirements for the riders, especially as it pertains to children or other shorter riders.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help the ride attendants follow the rules, you've been asked to write an app to help them know if the riders are acceptable for the car.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic rules are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. No one under 36 inches may ever ride, either by themselves or with another rider.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Normally, two riders sit in the car together. A single rider can only ride if they are at least 18 years old and are at least 62 inches tall.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If there are two riders and one of them is at least 18 years old, they may ride together.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### CORE REQUIREMENTS\n",
    "1. Prompt the user for the age and height of the first person. Then, ask whether there is a second rider, and if so, ask for their age and height.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Handle the case of a single rider.\n",
