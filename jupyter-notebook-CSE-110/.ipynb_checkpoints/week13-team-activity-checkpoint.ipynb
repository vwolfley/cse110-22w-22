    "Write functions to compute and return the areas of squares, rectangles, and circles. These functions should not display the values directly, but rather should return them, so they could be used in other parts of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CORE REQUIREMENTS\n",
    "Work through these core requirements step-by-step to complete the program. Please don't skip ahead and do the whole thing at once, because others on your team may benefit from building the program up slowly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function compute_area_square that accepts a single value as a parameter, and then computes the area and returns it.\n",
    "\n",
    "01. Below the function, write code to prompt the user for the side of a square and save it into a variable, then pass this variable to the function to compute the area. Finally, get the result back from the function and display it.\n",
    "\n",
    "02. Repeat the previous step to write and test the functions compute_area_rectangle and compute_area_circle.\n",
    "\n",
    "03. Write a loop to ask the user what kind of shape they have, then prompt for the length of a side, or sides, or radius, and then calls the appropriate function, and displays the result. The program should continue looping until the user enters \"quit\" for the shape."
