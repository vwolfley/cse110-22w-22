    "01. Loop through the items in the regular way (for example, for thing in the_list) and display each one to make sure you have the initial list built correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "02. Add another loop to go through and print the items in the list, but this time, instead of using the for ... in syntax, use an index (for example, for ... in range) and then access the item using the index and the square brackets. Print the index in front of the items like so: 0. Milk\n",
