    "\n",
    "## Assignment\n",
    "For this project, the user will be given a menu and have the ability to choose items from the menu. The options in the menu include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "01. Add a new item\n",
    "\n",
    "02. Display the contents of the shopping cart\n",
    "\n",
    "03. Remove an item (only needed for the final project deliverable)\n",
    "\n",
    "04. Compute the total (only needed for the final project deliverable)\n",
    "\n",
    "05. Quit\n",
    "\n",
    "When the user chooses one of these options, the program should perform the appropriate action. Then the program should show them the menu again, and allow them to choose another option. It should continue running until the user choose the option to quit.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Milestone Requirements\n",
    "At the end of Lesson 09, to help make sure you are on track to finish the assignment, you need to complete the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "01. Have menu system that repeats until the user chooses quit.\n",
    "\n",
    "02. Create a list that will store the names of the items in the shopping cart.\n",
    "\n",
    "03. Complete the option to add the name of the item to the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "04. Complete the option to display the names of the items in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Final Requirements\n",
    "In addition to the functionality above, for the final project, you also need to complete the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "01. Store prices as well as names.\n",
    "\n",
    "02. Change the add functionality to also ask for and store the price of the item.\n",
    "\n",
    "03. Change the display functionality to also display the prices of the items.\n",
    "\n",
    "04. When displaying the items, display a number in front of each item. The numbers should start with 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "05. Complete the option to display the total amount of the prices of all the items in the shopping cart.\n",
    "\n",
    "06. Whenever prices are displayed, they should be shown to two decimal places.\n",
    "\n",
    "07. Complete the option to remove an item from the shopping cart.\n",
    "\n",
    "08. When removing an item, you should verify the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Both the item name and price are removed from their respective lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The number the user enters should be converted to a 0-based index and checked to make sure it is within the bounds of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The program allows you to remove any item from the list including the first one and the last one. (Sometimes, if you have a bug in your project you might not allow removing the last item as you should.)"
