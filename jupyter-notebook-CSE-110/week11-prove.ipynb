    "01. What is the year and country that has the lowest life expectancy in the dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "02. What is the year and country that has the highest life expectancy in the dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "03. Allow the user to type in a year, then, find the average life expectancy for that year. Then find the country with the minimum and the one with the maximum life expectancies for that year.\n",

    "A sample run could look as follows:\n",

    ">Enter the year of interest: 1959\n",
    ">\n",
    ">The overall max life expectancy is: 86.751 from Monaco in 2019\n",
    ">The overall min life expectancy is: 17.76 from Iceland in 1882\n",
    ">\n",
    ">For the year 1959:\n",
    ">The average life expectancy across all countries was 54.95\n",

    "01. Download the dataset\n",

    "02. Load the dataset in your Python program\n",

    "03. Iterate through the data line by line\n",

    "04. Split each line into parts\n",
    "\n",
    "05. Find the lowest value for life expectancy and the highest value for life expectancy in the dataset. (Note that at this point, you just need the value for this, not the year and the country for that value.)"
